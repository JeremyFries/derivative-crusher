# derivative-crusher
This HTML file performs the derivative crushing process found in thermodynamics, a process that allows the user to express partial derivatives in terms of easily measurable thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, pressure, coefficient of thermal expansion, etc. 

This program is in its beta form as a proof-of-concept. In future releases I plan to show step-by-step instructions, improve the UI, remove debugging text, and make some other tweaks that affect solution readability. I would like to host it as its own website as well.
